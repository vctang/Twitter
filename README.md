# Project 4 - *Twitter*

**Twitter** is a Twitter-based app using the [The Twitter API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: 
Week 1: ~7 hours

Week 2: ~15 hours

**23** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [X] User can sign in using OAuth login flow
- [X] User can view last 20 tweets from their home timeline
- [X] The current signed in user will be persisted across restarts
- [X] In the home timeline, user can view tweet with the user profile picture, username, tweet text, and timestamp. In other words, design the custom cell with the proper Auto Layout settings.
- [X] Retweeting and favoriting should increment the retweet and favorite count.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User can load more tweets once they reach the bottom of the feed using infinite loading similar to the actual Twitter client.
- [ ] User should be able to unretweet and unfavorite and should decrement the retweet and favorite count. Refer to this guide for help on implementing unretweeting.
- [ ] User can pull to refresh.

The following **additional** features are implemented:
- [X] Customized Navigation Bar (Blue bar, white text)
- [X] Customized status bar (from black to white)
- [X] Retweet/Favorites button changes color when pressed

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Customize retweet before posting
2. Post your own tweet

## Notes
- Autolayout was difficult with the extra retweet/favorite/reply button
- Had difficulty implementing User in Tweet.
